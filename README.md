# Next Firebase Boilerplate

The goal of this project is

A typical usecase for this app is as a two-sided marketplace, so this boilerplate is optimized for that type of interaction.

- User roles: "admin", "supplier" (drivers), "customer" (riders)
- Basic data integration
  - 5 users of various types
  - 3 items of supply
  - one customer with a completed order
